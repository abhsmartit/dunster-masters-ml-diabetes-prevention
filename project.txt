Masters in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Project Title:
“Design and Implementation of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Models for
Data-Driven Decision Making and Organizational Performance Enhancement”
Project Brief:
This project focuses on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques
are applied to real-world datasets to support data-driven decision making and improve
organizational performance. The learner will design, develop, and evaluate suitable AI/ML
models to solve practical business or operational problems, emphasizing accuracy, scalability,
and ethical use of data.

Key Requirements:
1, Problem / Domain Selection
● Select one application area such as business analytics, finance, healthcare, operations,
marketing, or risk analysis
● Clearly define the problem statement and objectives

2. Data Understanding & Preparation
● Data collection and preprocessing
● Feature selection and data transformation

3. Model Development
● Selection of appropriate AI / ML algorithms
● Model training, testing, and validation

4. Performance Evaluation
● Model accuracy and performance metrics
● Comparison of results and interpretation
5. Application & Improvement Strategy
● Practical application of results
● Recommendations for model improvement and deployment
Final Output
A structured 15,000–20,000 word dissertation.Inclusion of machine learning models, algorithms,
evaluation metrics, and result analysis.Model architectures, datasets, and performance
summaries to be included as appendices where required.
